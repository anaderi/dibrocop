Abstract
--------

Dibrocop project makes an attempt to use modern in-browser computation platforms
to solve a wide variety of problems.

Modern browsers have special code paths for low overhead calculations, e.g.
ASM.js by Firefox and PNaCl by Chromium. In contrast to SETI@Home and other
public volunteer computing projects, our approach requires no software installation and
starts as soon as you open the page in your web browser. It doesn't have
any requirements for operating system or device capabilities.

In this report we are going to share our experience in moving computational
tasks to ASM.js and PNaCl.
